Mondrian
===========================================================

Mondrian is a Django site for multimedia annotations facilitating
collaboration on video and image analysis. Developed at the Columbia
Center for New Media Teaching and Learning (CCNMTL)
http://github.com/ccnmtl/Mondrian

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Mondrian relies on several submodules.  The easiest way to download
   it all is to run with git 1.6.5+ is:

  git clone --recursive http://github.com/ccnmtl/mondrian.git 

2. Bootstrap uses virtualenv to build a contained library in ve/
  ./bootstrap.py

(The rest of the instructions work like standard Django.  See:
 http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/
 for more details.
)

3. Build the (postgres) database
  createdb mondrian
  ./manage.py syncdb
  #create a superuser

4. Run locally (during development)
  ./manage.py runserver myhost.example.com:8000

5. For deployment to Apache, see our sample configuration in apache/prod.conf
   This directory also contains standard django.wsgi file which can be used 
   with other webservers

#Go to your site in a web browser.
6. The default database is not very useful.  Login with the superuser you
   created in Step #3, and then click the Admin link in the upper right.
7. Create a group (and a second for faculty) and a course (and users, e.g.)
8. Experiment with saving assets by visiting:
   http://myhost.example.com:8000/save/
