1. You need to create the CourseAffiliation table. ./manage.py syncdb should do this.

2. You need to add the "context" column, which is a foreign key into the CourseAffiliation table.  This seems to work:
 ALTER TABLE assetmgr_asset ADD COLUMN context_id INT;

3. You need to create a course affiliation for each user linking them to the 'summer09' course.  You can do this in the django admin ui. (A bit tedious, sorry)

4. You need to update each asset to assign a course affiliation to it, representing the course it was added to and the user who added it. (A bit tedious, sorry)
