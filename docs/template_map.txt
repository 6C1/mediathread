Basically the templates live in three locations on the filesystem.

=====================
./templates/assetmgr/
=====================

 * asset.html: The Class Record (Analysis) screen, which displays all tags and
   comments made on the record, lets users add new comments, and lets users 
   annotate the record or a clipped segment of the record

 * asset_container.html: The Class Saved Records screen, which displays all assets
   that have been added and their tags (for filtering the results)

 * asset_addform.html: A mock entry point into the application to simulate the
   workflow of the "Analyze This Record" button

=====================
./templates/projects/
=====================

 * asset_table.html: Renders a user's saved records in a series of collapsible divs,
   each with a table of annotations. Not intended as a full-page template; it is
   included into the your_records.html and project.html templates. Its functionality
   is influenced by two context variables. If `editable` is True, then various "edit"
   and "delete" buttons will be rendered. If `page_in_edit_mode` is True, then links
   will be rendered with "target=_blank" (to prevent loss of unsaved changes) and
   "add to project" buttons will be rendered. Note: this template doesn't currently
   include any JS, but does assume some.

 * your_records.html: The Your Space (Saved Records) screen, which lists all assets
   that have been clipped, tagged, or noted by the user, and lists all annotations
   that have been saved by the user.

 * your_projects.html: The Your Space (Projects) screen, which lists all projects
   that are associated with the user.

 * portal.html: The Class Portal screen, which lists the most recently added
   assets, the most popular assets, and all tags.

 * project.html: The Project Workspace, where a user can edit a project draft
   and associate clips with it, as well as saving, printing and submitting the
   draft.

 * published_project.html: A read-only view of a project's contents, so that users
   may view each other's (submitted/published) projects.

 * classlisting.html: The Class Listing, which displays the collected annotations
   and completed projects by all users in the class.

=====================
./templates/comments/
=====================

 * form.html: The comment form, rendered on the Class Record (Analysis) screen
   whose template lives at ./templates/assetmgr/asset.html

============
./templates/
============

 * base.html: The main template that wraps all other templates in the application
