Need to work around the foreign key constraint in the Versions Models so that objects can be deleted but still have 
their records persist in the shadow table.

Removing the foreign key would work, but would also remove the versions attribute from the model.

Best option may be to remove the foreign key, and manually set 'versions' to be a model manager for VersionModels
that automatically adds the current object as a constraint.
