  <p>Work in Mediathread centers around <b>Items</b>, <b>Projects</b>, and <b>Discussions</b>:</p>


  <p><b>Items</b> are images or videos that have been saved and annotated in MediaThread.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Media sources must first be imported into MediaThread before they can be saved as Items.</li>
    <li>Many videos and images posted online may be imported into MediaThread.</li>
    <li>To prioritize media sources for your course, you can queue up supported collections or import a core group of Items for analysis.  See instructions in the Explore Collections tab.
</li>
    <li>All Items in MediaThread are available to all members of the class.</li>
    
  </ul>
  
  <p><b>Projects</b> are written compositions with embedded Items.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Any MediaThread user can create a project and add collaborators.
    </li>
    <li>A project may be saved as a private draft, in which case it is visible only to its author(s).  It may also be published and made visible to the instructor, the whole class, or the world.</li>
    <li>Instructors have another publishing option:  they may save a project as an "assignment" for the class, so responses can be tracked here, in the Instructor Dashboard. 
    <li>
Projects may be discussed by Instructors posting "Instructor Feedback".  Class members are alerted to Feedback posted on their Project(s).

    </li>
	<li>Any Project created by an instructor and made visible to the class, whether or not it is an assignment, will appear on the Class Home.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <p><b>Discussions</b> are conversations about specific topics.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Topic-level discussions are accessible to the whole class but can only be created by instructors here in the Instructor Dashboard.</li>
    <li>
Once created, topic-level Discussions appear on the Class Home page.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Read tips for organizing your course in MediaThread:</h4>

  <p>
    Potentially useful student activities may include one or more of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Finding and/or organizing source media for a shared respository or independent analysis.</li>
    <li>Analyzing a single Item or multiple Items.</li>
    <li>Participating in one or more Discussions.</li>
    <li>Composing projects either independently or in response to your "assignments."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Because there is such a great variety of ways to use Mediathread in a Course, it's highly recommended that you document, contextualize and organize the activities you want students to do in an explicit way.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any project you share with the class will automatically appear on the Class Home page.
    </li>
    <li>Only Projects "published" as "assignment" are recognized by Mediathread as officially "assigned" class activities.  These will automatically be grouped and highlighted for your students.
    </li>
    <li>Since Items and Discussions cannot be formally grouped or flagged as "assignment," you may want to create and share a Project titled "Syllabus," "Assignments, " etc. for this purpose. 
    </li>
  </ul>
