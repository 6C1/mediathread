You'll need three terminals, one to execute the twill scripts and two to serve the application.
This is because one of the server-side handlers in analyze_it.twill makes a synchronous HTTP call 
to the test server, but the test server only handles one request at a time, so the tests will
hang forever unless you put up two servers.

1) ./ftests/serve 8001
2) ./ftests/serve 8002
3) ./ftests/run
